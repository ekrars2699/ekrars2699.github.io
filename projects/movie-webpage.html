            <h2> Context </h2>
            <p>The Movie Webpage Project is a project where I made a site with a partner. The site we made was about a fictional movie that we came up with.</p>
            <h2> Content </h2>
            <p>The project requires us to have both HTML and CSS in it. Before we started the actual project we had to make a plan for the project. In the plan we had split up the requirements of the project. The requirements are: </p>
            <h4> HTML Requirements</h4>
            <li>Headings </li>
            <li>Paragraphs</li>
            <li> Divs and Spans </li>
            <li>Google Fonts </li>
            <li> Inputs and Sumbit </li>
            <h4> CSS Requirements </h4>
            <li> Selectors: element and class and id</li>
           <li> Padding, Border, and margin </li>
          <p> We also need at least 2 images that must be local.</p>
            <h2> Reflection </h2>
            <p> There were a few challenges while working on this project. We had a problem with deciding on how the site should look like. The design of our site had changed multiple times while making it.
                We had changed the color and the fonts used multiple times. I was in charge of the images that went on the site and at first I couldn't decide on which images I should choose. 
                Many of the images I didn't fit the theme of the movie. After searching I was eventually able to find 2 images that related to the story of our movie. Other problems we had were related to meeting the requirements of the project, such as some of our code not working which caused us to review our notes or ask for help. </p>
            <h4> Takeaways</h4>
            <p> While working on this project I learned the value of having a plan. This project was the first time a plan was a requirement and it greatly helped us. The plan made it so that we could meet the requirements and so we don't stay stuck on one thing. If we didn't have a plan we wouldn't have been able to add some of the things that made our site look good, for example the background which changes color as you go down.</p>
            <h4> Next Steps</h4>
            <p>In the future I would like to add more details that would make our site more unique. I would also like to do the extra cedit which is to make a sequel to our movie.</p>
