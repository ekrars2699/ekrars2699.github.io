<h1 class="margin text-center"> Freedom Project </h1>
            <h2> Context </h2>
            <p> The Freedom Project is a year long project. For this project we chose a topic to research and make a website on. For the project we researched current technologies used for the subject we chose. Then for part B of the project we made our own possible future technologies for the project. We learned HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to make our website. We then learned our own tool to improve our website.</p>
            <h2> Content </h2>
            <p>I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Github. I also chose to independently study Forensic Science in order to help me make my website. My website is able to inform the viewer of many various things about forensic science such as technologies that are currently in use by forensic scientists. On my website I'v also made possible future inventions for forensic scientists to use. During the "Freedom Project" I learned a tool called A-Frame to help me better show my ideas for future inventions. 
            </p>
            <h2> Reflection </h2>
            <p> This project was enjoyable. I started it at the start of the year where I didn't know much about HTML, CSS or Bootstrap but as I learned more about those topics and coding in general I started getting better. I used all the knowledge I gained from this class to make my website the way it is now. I also researched forensic science, a topic that I find interesting. This project gave me an opportunity to learn more about this topic. I made sure to finish an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) first so that I have a finished product. After I finished my MVP I added this that weren't required but made my website better.  </p>
            <h4> Takeaways</h4>
            <p> One of my major takeaways is to stop procrastinating. Procrastination has caused me to rush some aspects of my project making it so that I couldn't do everything I wanted. I also thing that making a plan really helped me finish my project because I was able to know what I needed to do. I also asked my classmates for help in order to help me fix things on my website. For my tool of A-frame, I had multiple issues so I asked some classmates who also used the tool in order to fix my problems. Many of my problems were also caused by typos and not reviewing my code, by reviewing my code I was able to fix issues that broke major parts of my website.  </p>
            <h4> Next Steps</h4>
            <p> Next time I do a project or make a website like this I'd like to make sure to not procrastinate. Doing things on time will allow me to not stress about my projects and it'll allow me to improve the overall quality of them.</p>
